    Safety First! is a twin stick physics puzzler in which you have to fix
    broken electric wires using your Magical Yellow Repair Liquid (MYRL).
    Get ready for a challenging journey through a variety of gameplay
    mechanics and hilarious sound design. Can you beat all 69 levels?

    Your grandma turned her vintage radio up too much and caused lots
    of cables to break in the nearby power plant. With your awesome
    electrician skills you embark on a mission to fix all those
    broken wires employing your Magical Yellow Repair Liquid. Get
    ready for a challenging and physically totally accurate journey!

    Control your character's feet using the thumb sticks of your
    gamepad. Be warned though, he's quite fragile. Deploy Magical
    Yellow Repair Liquid where necessary so your grandma can enjoy
    her favorite tune again.

    For your convenience we included "Grandma's favorite tune" in
    the credits scroller

    Totally awesome features in 69 levels throughout 3 campaigns
    
    Classic campaign with 30 levels
    
    Advanced campaign with another even weirder 32 levels. Looking
    for some gameplay variation? Try this mode: You can only lift
    one foot at a time. One foot stays on the ground.
    
    Space (yes, Space!) campaign: A couple of more levels with 
    zero gravity
    
    
    Tons of (well, three) play modes:

    NRML: default
    
    PEP: everything is faster, flashing light, faster music
    
    DRNK: world rocks back and forth, rock music, alternate
    voice audio, brown Myrlballs
    
    Fun to fail, quick to retry!

    What else?

    Interact with various physics driven objects
    Immersive sound effects and voice acting
    Interactive soundtrack that constantly changes
    Lots of achievements
    Entertaining to watch and listen to. You will tell your grandkids about it someday.
